📊 Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn and retention patterns using a real-world telecom subscription dataset.
The objective was to identify:
● Why customers leave
● Which segments are most at risk
● Key retention drivers
● Actionable strategies to reduce churn
The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for product managers, founders, and business stakeholders.
🎯 Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer lifetime value in subscription-based businesses.
This analysis answers:
● Which contract types have the highest churn?
● Do short-tenure customers leave more often?
● Does pricing influence churn behavior?
● How do demographics affect retention?
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
● Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard development
● Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
● DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI and metric calculations
